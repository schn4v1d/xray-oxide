# XRay Oxide

An open-source reimplementation in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) of the XRay Engine used in the
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games by GSC Game World.

Based on [OpenXRay](https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16)
and [XRay Monolith](https://bitbucket.org/anomalymod/xray-monolith).

# Vision

The End-Goal of this project is to support the three original S.T.A.L.K.E.R games and Stalker Anomaly to improve
performance and quality of life for modders.
